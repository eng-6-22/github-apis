    "What we just did was access information from an API, and that is preferred way that we can get public data on the web.  An API is just a service thatÂ we can ask for information, like we did with our code above, and the service gives us back some data.  Don't worry if that's not exactly clear -- we'll talk a lot about APIs later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important point is that with just a few keystrokes we can write some code that asks for information, and that information is sent back to us to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important point is that there are a lot of APIs available to us, and we can ask any of them for information.  For example, if we would like to get back information about a restaurants near us. Well we can ask the website Foursquare for this information.  And that is also eight words.  And almost all of those words are the same as before."
