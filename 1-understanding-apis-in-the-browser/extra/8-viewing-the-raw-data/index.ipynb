To request different kinds of information, we change the URL with names that specify what kind of information we would like back.  After making this request to a website or web service, the website sends us back some information.  In this lesson we'll dig in just a little deeper about requests, and also the data sent back in the response.  After this lesson, we'll learn some Python and start writing code to make our own customized requests and receive back responses."
