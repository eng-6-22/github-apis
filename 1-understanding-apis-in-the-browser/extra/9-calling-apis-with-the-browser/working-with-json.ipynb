    "In the last lesson we learned some of the details of a request and a response.  We saw that there are two types of requests, GET requests which ask for information, and POST requests which create new information like when we fill out a form.  We saw that when we visit a website, this response generally comes in the form of HTML, and our browser translates this HTML into the colors and fonts that you see on the page.  Well, in this lesson we'll see a different type of data that a website can send back in a response, JSON.  And we'll see how we call websites that send back responses in this form Web APIs, which are quite useful to us as data scientists."

An API  an application programming interface, where the application is a website that sends back JSON (that squiggly stuff above), and the interface to use that website are the various URLs we can type in to get back data.  An API also adheres to the request response cycle (it's just a website), so we request information from the API by typing in a URL and the response is the data in the form of JSON that we get back.
