That's fine - we'll understand it when we learn Python, which  we'll focus on Python throughout the whole next unit.  For now, it's enough to appreciate that we are both able to write the code above, and understand why that code makes sense.  With this knowledge (and some practice), we can request information from a variety of APIs."
